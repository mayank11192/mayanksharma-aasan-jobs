1.//check for repeated number
int main()
{
int i, A[];
for (i=0;i<A[i];i++);
{
if(A[i+1]-A[i]==0)
cout<<"number repeated";
break;
else
cout<<A[i];
}


3.//to find pair closest to zero
void printClose(int arr[], int n)
{
    int l = 0, r = n-1, diff = INT_MAX, left, right;
     while (r > l)
    {
       if (abs(arr[l] + arr[r] - 0) < diff)
       {
          left= l;
          right = r;
           diff = abs(arr[l] + arr[r] - 0);
       }
       if (arr[l] + arr[r] > 0)
           r--;
       else 
           l++;
    }
    cout <<" The pair close to zero is " << arr[left] << " and " << arr[right];
}
int main()
{
    int arr[] =  {15, 5, -20, 30, -45};
    printClose(arr, n);
    return 0;
}

2.//website for a travel company
1. first we will make header of the web page "welcome to xyz company" and adjust its properties
2.then we make two tabs on page "signup" "sign in"
3. for "signup" we make a form in this to take details name, mob no. , email , password etc. store this in data base
4.for "signin" we will chk email and password of the user then user logs in
5. then client can choose destination , dates , chk fare, availability.
6.only after logs in user can confirm his journey else he can only inqire about location and fare.
*this is the very basic approach*
